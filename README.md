Manufacturing Analyst Project

This is my 2nd Project and This project focused on analyzing large-scale garment manufacturing data to assess operational performance, identify inefficiencies, and support decision-making. Using Power BI dashboards, I visualized key metrics such as manufactured quantity, rejected items, wastage percentage, and production trends.

I examined employee-wise and machine-wise rejection rates, operation-wise defect patterns, and department-level production efficiency. The analysis revealed critical improvement areas, such as specific machines and operations causing higher rejection rates.

Key Outcomes:

Reduced data silos by centralizing production and rejection data into a single dashboard.

Helped the production team prioritize machine maintenance and employee training.

Identified declining production trends, prompting management to address resource or seasonal impacts.

Provided actionable insights that supported waste reduction and process optimization.
